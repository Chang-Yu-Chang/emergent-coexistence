How to I cross-refer a figure in R notebook \@ref(fig:experimental-design)


```{r experimental-design, fig.cap="**Experimental design for the competitive networks in self-assembled communities**. Derived from leaf and soil microbiomes, microbial communities were assembled in the simple synthetic media (M9 salts and glucose). After 12 growth cycles, the final stable communities were sequenced. The microbial strains in these self-assembled communities were isolated and were co-cultured at known frequencies on the same synthetic media for eight growth cycles. In the end of competition, the co-cultures were plated on solid media to identify the colonies. The colonies of each competitor were counted to determine the final frequencies. Invasion networks were build based on the outcomes of pairwise competitions."}
